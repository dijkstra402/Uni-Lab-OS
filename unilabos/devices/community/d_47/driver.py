## SERIAL_LOGGER.PY - logs data received over a serial port, coming from a scale of type "Ohaus Defender 5000"
# By fokke@bronsema.net, version 3 of February 2024
#
# Usage: python serial_logger.py <serial port> <path of output file>
#
# Features:
# - reads data frames from a scale (tested with "Ohaus Defender 5000") and stores this in a csv-file on a USB stick; 
# - Filename is based on the mac address of Pi (to distinguish logs from multiple instances of this logger) and the timestamp in the first data frame; 
# - able to deal with removal of USB drive, will store data locally and copy file to USB stick once inserted;
# - self update: if a file with the same name and with a newer version (see SCRIPTVERSION-paramater below) is found on the USB drive, 
#   this newer version will be installed and started;
# - status output to a LED (red=error, green=ok, briefly blue=data frame received and stored);
# - textual messages to an optional LCD-screen (16x2) which can be switched on/off by the script (controlled via LCD_PIN)
# - Writes log information to stdout
# 
# One packet is about 100 chars @ (9600 Baud = 960 bytes/sec) => packet time is about 0.1 sec
# Script needs to be run as root to be able to mount usb drives and access serial ports
#
# Tested with a Raspberry Pi model B+ v1.2 running Debian Bookworm, Python 3.11. 
#
# installation steps:
# - install OS on an SD-card; 
# - put SD in Pi, connect monitor and keyboard, power up, configure via menu, keyboard and user (e.g.: logger);
# - login, select root: sudo su;
# - apt update && sudo apt upgrade;
# - create mount point for USB, for example: mkdir /media/logdata
# - create temporary folder to store files when no usb drive is present: mkdir /root/serial_logger
# - apt install pip (to be able to install additional Python modules)
# - pip install pyserial psutil (needed to use the serial port and get the mac-address, execute as root because the script will run as root)
# - optional: raspi-config: switch on ssh, set timezone, hostname, overclock, .. 
# - optional: copy lines in rc.local to /etc to auto start the script when starting the Pi
# - optional: connect power button and power led
# - optional: copy the lines in /boot/config.txt to use the power on/power down button and power LED
# - optional: raspi-config: sudo pip RPLCD smbus to use an external i2c display (do not switch on i2c in raspi-config).
