class MeasurementDeviceChooser(ALPHA, Temp_336, Quatro, Agilent4980A, Agilent3458A, Keysight_MSO_X_3014T, NIMaxScreenshots):
    """We need to do some work to get the correct device object. Initial goal was to build this in a way that it would
     be straight forward to implement a new hardware device and not need to change more than one additional line of
     code in the existing code base. The result after all magic is supposed to be an object from a specific hardware
     class (eg an ALPHA object) accessible to the MeasurementDeviceController (present in MeasurementComponents.py)
     accessible via the *instrument* link. so accessing measurementdevicecontroller.instrument should call methods
     from the actual ALPHA class.
     To make sure all methods are implemented that need to be implemented yet staying flexible, inheritance is used
     extensively. So all hardware devices are child classes of the *MeasurementDevice* super class. This class itself
     has both abstractmethods (methods, that each and every hardware class has to implement on their own) and each
     and each and every special method any hardware might implement (so to always have it available even if it will
     just return false.

     The MeasurementDeviceChooser is a child class of all hardware device classes. This means that we get sort of a
     diamond shape of inheritance (MeasurementDeviceChooser->ALPHA and Generic ->MeasurementDevice). We can now
     use the *super* method to call the super-classes method. We can thereby call every detect_device method via a
     single super() call in MeasurementDeviceChooser. As MeasurementDevice has the attribute recognized_dev, every
     method called can access it and add to the list. That's just the device detection. Also note: *It's important
     to always call super() in the respective chardware classes methods because otherwise it will result in not all
     methods called!*

     Device selection is a little bit trickier: We get a specific entry of the recognized_devs list as input,
     consisting of the visa Resource name on index 0 and the idn name on index 1. We will now call via super all
     hardware classes' select_device methods and will set the self.mes_device to a new object of its own class. So
     if the select_device method is called via super in the ALPHA class AND the idn matches, MeasurementDeviceChooser's
     mes_device will be set to a new ALPHA object. Additionally, it will also use the index 0 from recognized_dev
     (singular!) to set the visa_dev and open the resource so ALPHAobject.visa_instrument can actually be called and
     worked with (eg via .query() ). Externally in the MeasurementDeviceController, this can now be read
     out and mapped to instrument. So from the MeasurementDeviceController object . instrument will be an ALPHA object.
     This means that the correct and specific implementation of the methods as described in ALPHA class will
     be called."""
